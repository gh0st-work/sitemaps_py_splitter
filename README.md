# sitemaps_py_splitter

Split large sitemaps (python). Just script that can save ur 30 min

**I faced the problem of splitting a large sitemap into several smaller ones and did not find a ready-made solution.**

For people familiar with python, it will be clear what to edit.

In the "sitemaps_read" folder, upload large sitemap files, edit the parameters (sitemaps_server_url, last_mod...), at the output we get sitemaps of the required size and sitemap index in the "sitemaps_done" folder.
